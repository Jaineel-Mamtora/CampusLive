# CampusLive

## Overview:

 As far as events are concern, students are not able to find them instantly, and sometimes, when they find, they miss the registration dates. To solve this problem, we have built centralized website CampusLive, which serves a platform for various Event organizers to promote their events to vast amount of audiences. Its main aim is to bridge the gap between students and organizers by keeping the students up-to-date of what’s happening in their Campus.  Also it helps the students to register for the said events.


## Objective and Scope:

- To minimize the communication gap between the event organizers and the students.
- To make event schedules easily accessible
- To provide notification about current and upcoming events
